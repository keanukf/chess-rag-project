# Chess RAG Project

Welcome to the Chess RAG Project! This project involves the deployment of a chatbot that answers questions regarding chess game results based on real chess data.

## Project Overview

The Chess RAG Project is an innovative web interface featuring an interactive chatbot. Users can query the chatbot in natural language to gain insights into chess games, without the need for any coding. The chatbot includes data from 8 super Grandmasters (GMs), allowing users to ask anything they want to know about their games.

## Features

- **Interactive Chatbot**: Engage with a user-friendly chatbot interface.
- **Real Chess Data**: Access data from 8 super GMs.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Query the chatbot using natural language.
- **Web Interface**: No need to run anything locally; simply use the provided [webpage](https://chess-chatbot.webflow.io/).

## Installation

This GitHub repository contains the backend code, which is designed to run serverlessly on Google Cloud. There is no need for local installation. Simply visit the [webpage](https://chess-chatbot.webflow.io/) to interact with the chatbot.

## Usage

As this is an MVP, the chatbot is best suited for general questions. Edge cases and special queries may not be handled properly yet. Examples of suitable questions will be provided in future updates.
